Here is my Responsive portfolio that i have created for time being.
//PORTFOLIO PAGE//
When you open portfolio page, i tried to replicate as per the image given to us with some minor changes.
As per instructions, I used Bootstrap Bootstap grid system to place images of my portfolio .
I also used Sticky footer and made footer fixed at the bottom.
When you click navigation buttons in the header, it directs to the respective pages.


//CONTACT PAGE//


When you open contact Info page, I have created header with nav template from bootstrap with about,portfolio & contact buttons . So that when you click the buttons it navigates to respective pages.
I used Form template from bootstrap to get the form with fields for name, email & message.
I have also applied sticky footer to the footer nav.
I have also used bootstrap grid templates to get form and heading aliened properly.


//About PAGE//


When you open About page, I created header, footer with nav templates from bootstap.
I have included image and description on same row but in two equal columns.
Header consists of about,Portfolio,Contact info buttons so that when clicked directs to respective pages.
All the 3 pages were arranged to be responsive using some media queries.
